docker-compose up -d
		```
		

		Done!
		

		You can now access **https://${MAILCOW_HOSTNAME}** with the default credentials `admin` + password `moohoo`.
		

		The database will be initialized right after a connection to MySQL can be established.
		

		Your data will persist in multiple Docker volumes, that are not deleted when you recreate or delete containers. Run `docker volume ls` to see a list of all volumes. You can safely run `docker-compose down` without removing persistent data.
		

		

		**6\.** Using the Mailcow as Backup-MX
		

		**6\.1\.** Change password of user admin, in case you dod not do that (see above for the default login)
		**6\.2\.** 
		```
		Click on
		Configuration
		-- Mail Setup 
		--- Domains
		---- Add Domain
		

		Enter following Information:
		Domain: yourdomainhere.tld
		skip anything till
		Backup MX Options:
		Check both boxes
		Add Domain
		-> Repeat until the last domain
		-> Remind, its not possible to use alias domains as Backup-MX option, each domain has to be added manually
		-> On the Last Domain, use Add Domain and Restart SOGo
		```
		**6\.3\.** Add the Secondary host (Backup-MX(BMX)) as Relayhost to the Primary Host (Primary MX(PMX))
		```
		Login into your PMX
		Goto 
		- Configuration
		-- Configuration and Details
		--- Configuration
		---- Forwarding Hosts
		----- Enter the BMX as hostname
		------ Decide if you want to have the Spam Filter enabled or not.
		```
		

		**6\.4\.** Update your DNS
		MX1=PMX
		MX2=BMX
		

		```
		mx1.yourdomain.tld. 180 IN A 192.168.0.1
		mx2.yourdomain.tld. 180 IN A 192.168.0.2
		

		yourdomain.tld. 180 IN MX 20 mx2.yourdomain.tld.
		yourdomain.tld. 180 IN MX 10 mx1.yourdomain.tld.
		

		yourdomain.tld. 180 IN TXT "v=spf1 a mx a:mx1.yourdomain.tld a:mx2.yourdomain.tld ip4:192.168.0.1/32 ip4:192.168.0.2/32 ~all"
		```
		

		**6\.5\.** Time to drink a Coffe...
		It may take some time, that the DNS changes to take effect (usually some minutes, but it can also take days!)
		If this is done, you can check your domain with
		```
		dig yourdomain.tld MX
		```
		If its telling 2 Entries (or more, if you set up more as twice) then it's fine
		as Written above, it should be looking like
		```
		yourdomain.tld. 180 IN MX 20 mx2.yourdomain.tld.
		yourdomain.tld. 180 IN MX 10 mx1.yourdomain.tld.
		``
		

		**6\.6\.** Time To Test!
		

		**6\.6\.1.\** PMX "Shutdown"
		Bring the PMX down and send an mail
		

		**6\.6\.2\** Check Queue on the BMX
		if you got now a mail fine
		if not, wait some minutes and check again
		

		**6\.6\.2\** PMX startup
		Start your stack again, and be happy ;)
